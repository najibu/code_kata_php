# Code Katas in PHP

If martial artists use kata as a method for exercise and practice, what might be the equivalent for coders, like us? Well, code katas are short, repeatable programming challenges, which are meant to exercise everything from your focus, to your workflow.

## Programming Challenges using TDD and PHPSpec

1. Prime Factors<br />
Use TDD to build a class that will compute the prime factors for any given number.
<br />
2. Roman Numerals<br />
Build a class that will automatically translate a number into its roman numeral counterpart.
<br />
3. Bowling Game
Recreate the scoring system for a game of bowling.
We deal with scoring spares, or strikes, or multiple strikes!
<br />
4. String Calculator<br />

<br />
5. Tennis Scoring<br />
Tennis scoring kata. If you're familiar with the game, you'll know that the rules can be a bit tricky. As such, this will make for a great exercise!
<br />
6. FizzBuzz<br />
Review the obligatory FizzBuzz exercise, and learn just how easy it is to solve.
<br />
7. Small Refactors and the Gilded Rose<br />
Tackle the intimidating Gilded Rose kata in PHP. Our job is to translate a monstrously confusing set of countless conditionals into a small series of readable methods.
